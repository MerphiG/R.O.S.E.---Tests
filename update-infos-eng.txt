[-v]1.0 Release<1.0[v-]
[-c]Welcome to Restoration Of Sonic.exe!

A Friday Night Funkin mod based on the cancelled “FNF Vs Sonic.exe”, originally run and led by RightburstUltra, MarStarBro, CommandoDev, Saster and Revie03.

The origin of our restoration mod has its origins in “Sonic.exe But I Restored It!”, a mod created and led by Futagami, which became very popular in 2022. Unfortunately, due to drama and various conflicts, this mod would also be cancelled. However, thanks to the lead coder at the time, Merphi, would take over the continuation of development under the name “RoSe” in November 2022.

The mod itself includes a lot of original and interesting content according to the team's vision of what a possible full “FNF Vs Sonic.exe” mod would have looked like if it hadn't been cancelled for good. But, as time went by, the mod would continue with its development deviating from the goal of restoring everything 100% accurately to improve the content, design and style of the mod. Also, the developers have their own point of view and give all the best they have to create an entertaining experience.

In this first Main Update, known as “RoSe Update 1.0”, you will be able to play a huge amount of content that has been in development for over 2 years, from songs of all kinds, such as classic songs that everyone knows, mixes and original tracks, unlock various interesting things, meet and challenge in rap battles a lot of Exes and strange characters related to the Sonic community and Sonic.exe throughout the Multiverse.

- +130 Playable Songs! {With a small amount of secret songs}
- Story Mode {2 Main Weeks, Xeno Week & ALT Week}
- Encore Mode {Round 2 against a handful of respective songs}
